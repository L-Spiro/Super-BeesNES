 * Description: A SNES emulator with the goal of being "micro-cycle–accurate." Many emulators claim to be "cycle-accurate"
 *	but are optimized to wait X cycles and then pump out all the work or otherwise do not actually divide all the work across
 *	all the cycles. In contrast, in this emulator, the work is correctly divided across the individual cycles for each
 *	instruction.
 * This means that multi-byte writes are correctly partitioned across cycles and partial data updates are possible, allowing
 *	for the more esoteric features of the system to be accurately emulated.  This means we should be able to support interrupt
 *	hijacking and any other cases that rely heavily on the cycle timing of the system.
 *
 * Additional options/features to facilitate accurate emulation:
 *	Start-Up: Start from known state or from random state.  Helps the random seed in some games.
 *	Hardware bugs will be emulated in both their buggy and fixed states (OAMADDR bugs (writing fewer than 8 ytes on the 2C02G)
 *		are examples of this).
 *	Unofficial opcodes used by games will be supported.
 *	The bus will be open and correctly maintain the last floating read.
 *	Etc.
 *
 * The CPU should be completely cycle-accurate, as every individual cycle is documented there. The same should apply to the
 *	PPU (questions surround PAL differences at the cycle level) and probably only loosely applies to the APU.  In the case of
 *	the APU, while each individual cycle may not be doing exactly the correct work, the goal is for the output to be exactly
 *	correct. This means envelope counters and sweep units etc. get updated within the correct cycles and then perhaps only
 *	minor adjustments to match the output exactly to the real thing.
 *
 * Timing will not be based off audio as is done in many emulators. We will use a real clock (with at minimum microsecond
 *	accuracy) and try to match real timings to real time units, which we can speed up and slow down as options.
 *
 * Performance should be decent enough for real-time. We are adding work to frames by adding a dereference and pointer-
 *	function call for each cycle, but the functions never leave instruction cache. If performance becomes a problem, it may
 *	warrant the creation of the approximate loops used in other emulators, leading to the scenario in which the approximate
 *	loops are used by most for gameplay and the slower original version of the emulator is used as a reference.
 *
 *
 * Other features will include:
 *	A debugger.
 *	A disassembler.
 *	An assembler.
 *	1-877-Tools-4-TAS.
 *		- Stepping and keylogging.
 *		- Movie-making.
